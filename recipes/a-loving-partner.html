    <h2>So wanna actually get some pussy?</h2>
    <p>Lets be honest here buddy, you're kinda fucked, you don't exercise and think you are better for the world
        as another corpse 6 ft under, but the truth is that you're actually worth something... or at least will.</p>
    <p>First of all, stop being a bitch, do stuff, start doing shit, language, study, hobbies, go out, explore, do 
        shit, otherwise you'll be uninteresting and no one wants that.</p>
    <h2>What do?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Get some sun</li>
        <li>Exercise 3 times a week</li>
        <li>Read a book every two weeks</li>
        <li>Study another language</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>In order of importance you should...</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>NOT install dating apps, just don't bro, literally just go out, that'll be a lot better for you</li>
        <li>Dress better, get a hair cut and try to socialize randomly on the streets</li>
        <li>After a while you'll stop being so antisocial and ackward, a girl will take interest, if you
            like her too then go ahead and start dating, you'll eventually meet someone to be with
        </li>
    </ol>
