    <div class="title big">Who doesn't like some good good?</div>
    <p>I love some good Spaghetti, too bad my fucking lighter just broke</p>
    <p>You might be asking, does that happen often? and not, it doesn't but I guess I am just fucked right now!</p>
    <p>Anyways, lets start with the recipe</p>
    <div class="title big">Preparation</div>
    <div class="title small">Ingredientes needed</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Canned Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Pasta</li>
</ul>
    <div class="title small">Steps</div>
    <ol>
        <li>Put water in a deep pan, salt it heavily, this is the seasoning that will go into the pasta 
            so don't skimp on it, you goddamn whore.
        </li>
        <li>Once it boils, slap some pasta on the boiling water, you thought this was a Spaghetti recipe?
            Well get fucked, this is an universal recipe, lets see if you stop being a lil bitch and have
            the balls to improvise a little, sheesh.
        </li>
        <li>After around 10 minutes pull it out, drain the water and slap some of that tomato sauce on top
            of the pasta, grate some cheese on top and you're good to go! You've made yourself a meal, maybe
            next you can ask chatGPT to do it for you instead, the future is today, baby!
        </li>
    </ol>
